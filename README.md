The dataset is named entrp.srch and is in LETOR format.  

The XGBoost script used to train, test and validate the LambdaMart Learning-to-Rank model is also attached.

# How to Run
The attached dataset and code were used to perform four ranking performance tests.  To reproduce, simply download the code (python ipynb file) and LTR dataset (txt file).  It was compliled using python 3 - the script will download any required packages.
